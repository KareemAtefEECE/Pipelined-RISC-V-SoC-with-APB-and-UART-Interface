# Pipelined-RISC-V-SoC-with-APB-and-UART-Interface

Note: The full details about the project and explanation can be found in the pdf file (Final Report within the same repository).

The project mainly consists of: <br>
1) A Pipelined RISC-V Processor (RV32I), with an 
APB Master interface. 
2) An APB Address Decoder (Generates the correct 
PSEL signal to each peripheral based on address according to the memory map).
3) A UART with an APB Slave interface and Register 
Layering.
